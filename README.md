SynkBoard

Where ideas take visual form

A modern, high-performance, single-page creative whiteboard application built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
SynkBoard enables drawing, sketching, diagramming, and visual thinking directly in the browser with a clean, professional interface and zero backend dependencies.

Why SynkBoard

SynkBoard is designed as a portfolio-grade project that demonstrates advanced frontend engineering, Canvas API mastery, and refined UI and UX design — all implemented without frameworks.

It answers an important recruiter question:

Can this developer build complex, interactive creative tools entirely from core web technologies?

SynkBoard proves the answer is yes.
